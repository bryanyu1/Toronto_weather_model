# Toronto_weather_model
I conducted an exploration in R on Toronto's temperature and precipitation patterns between 2013-2018. This was completed for STAT371 at the University of Waterloo. The goal of this project was to determine if there was any statistical significance or relationship between mean temperature and mean precipitation in Toronto. All analysis conducted was raw; it was cleaned up, discussed, and submitted in a report format. 
 
Data: The uploaded data (csv) file was pulled from Statistics Canada: Toronto_temp_edited.csv. It contains numerous weather-associated variables with varying relevance to temperature and/or precipitation. It was edited to ensure all dates were correctly populated, and there were no data issues such as missing values.
